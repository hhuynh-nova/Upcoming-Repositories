# Upcoming-Repositories
This repository will state any in-progress repository for class projects that will be released after the project has been finished


## 1. CRS Agricultural App

If the CRS group does not want the app code to be released as a public repository, I will ask if I may upload a bare template for the app screens on my GitHub account.
This app is being written with React Native and uses a SQL database at the moment.


## 2. Ice Cream Database

This project will showcase an Oracle SQL database for an ice cream shop with schemas and ER diagrams.
